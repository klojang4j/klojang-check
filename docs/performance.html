            <h1>KLOJANG CHECK</h1>
            <h2>Performance</h2>
            <p>
                As you can tell from the code example in the <a href="index.html">Introduction</a>,
                Klojang Check exposes a fluent API, allowing you to execute multiple checks on the
                same value. That implies that there must be some object creation going on. So, just
                to address that worry right away, benchmarking Klojang Check using
                <a href="https://github.com/openjdk/jmh">JMH</a> yields no difference with hand-coded
                checks. You can view the results of the benchmarks <a href="https://github.com/openjdk/jmh">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>Looking at the code example, that should not be surprising. The object creation is
                completely localized and, in fact, completely redundant &#8211; the check object 
                created by <span class="inline-code">Check.that(...)</span> (more about which later)
                never gets assigned. Consequently, the JVM clearly has no trouble compiling it away
                altogether.
            </p>
            <h3>We Don't Check Your Checks</h3>
            <p>
                Perhaps paradoxically, while Klojang Check is all about ensuring your method's preconditions
                are met before doing anything else, Klojang Check itself does no such thing. Take, for
                instance, this statement:
            </p>
            <p class="java code">
Check.that(lastName).is(substringOf(), fullName);
            </p>
            <p>
                Since the <a href="https://klojang4j.github.io/klojang-check/api/org.klojang.check/org/klojang/check/CommonChecks.html#substringOf()">substringOf()</a> check
                simply wraps <span class="inline-code">String::contains</span>, this statement will fly 
                off the rails with a <span class="inline-code">NullPointerException</span> if any of the 
                provided arguments is null. Yet, Klojang Check will not perform a null check on any
                of them. We think this is justifiable. In the (rather) odd case that the check to be executed
                is not known beforehand and is dynamically inserted into the
                <span class="inline-code">is(...)</span> method, the check itself becomes program input and,
                hence, needs to be tested just like anything else entering your program. As for the
                <span class="inline-code">lastName</span> argument, which is the value we are testing, if
                it can possibly be null, the check simply should have been:
            </p>
            <p class="java code">
Check.notNull(lastName).is(substringOf(), fullName);
            </p>
            <p>
                Yet, the ultimate reason for not strutting your check with three or four additional checks
                is simply that it would be a show stopper for many developers. If you feel you should
                check the value of some variable in a tight loop, Klojang Check should not be the reason
                <i>not</i> to do it.
