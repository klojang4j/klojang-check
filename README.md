Naturalis Java Language Extensions Library

Java module containing basic language extensions and utility classes.

- Small footprint
- Self-contained  (zero dependencies outside the `java.*` namespace)
- Avoid duplication of functionality that is already present in libraries such as Apache Commons and Google Guava.
  However, since it is also meant to be self-contained, some overlap is inevitable

The javadocs can be
